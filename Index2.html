    <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three <em>fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.
  </p>
  <p> In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>
  <h2>What is HTML</h2>
  <p>HTML stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).
  </p>
  <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>
  <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>

<ol>
<li> The Opening tag.</li>
<li> The closing tag </li>
<li> The actual element</li>
</ol>
