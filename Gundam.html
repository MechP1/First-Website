    <p>
      Gundam (Japanese: ガンダムシリーズ, Hepburn: Gandamu Shirīzu, lit. Gundam
      Series) is a Japanese military fiction media franchise/media mix. Created
      by Yoshiyuki Tomino and Sunrise (now Bandai Namco Filmworks), the
      franchise features giant robots, or mecha, with the name "Gundam". The
      franchise began on April 7, 1979, with Mobile Suit Gundam, a TV series
      that defined the "real robot" mecha anime genre by featuring giant robots
      called mobile suits (including the original titular mecha) in a
      militaristic setting. The popularity of the series and its merchandise
      spawned a franchise that includes 50 TV series, films and OVAs as well as
      manga, novels and video games, along with a whole industry of plastic
      model kits known as Gunpla which makes up 90 percent of the Japanese
      character plastic-model market
    
    <p>As of March 2020, the franchise is fully owned by Bandai Namco Holdings through subsidiaries Sotsu and Sunrise. The Gundam franchise had grossed over $5 billion in retail sales by 2000. By 2014, annual revenue of the Gundam franchise reached ¥80 billion per year, ¥18.4 billion of which was retail sales of toys and hobby items.]</p>
